# Project Management System

The Project Management System was developed during my internship using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. The system is designed for a specific company to manage their projects, track progress, and collaborate with clients. It integrates several key features, including user authentication, project creation and management, and role-based access control.

For a more detailed overview of the project, visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/ARKTEEK/project-management-system/wiki) of this repository. The Wiki includes overview of the project, it's features, structure, technologies used and methods applied throughout development.
