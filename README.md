# Project Management System

The Project Management System was developed during my internship using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. This system is a private platform designed specifically for internal use by a company to manage its projects and client relationships. The system allows the company to oversee and assign projects to its client companies, track tasks, and manage users within both the company and client organizations.

For a more detailed overview of the project, visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/ARKTEEK/project-management-system/wiki) of this repository. The Wiki includes overview of the project, it's features, structure, technologies used and methods applied throughout development.
